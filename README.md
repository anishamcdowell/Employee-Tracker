## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to create a commandline application using Node JS and the Sequelize package to create and manipulate MySQL data/databases. The project is a sample of a business's structure, including departments and employees. Users interact with the commandline with the help of the Inquirer package. Options to view current databases or to add new data to the current databases are given in the commandline via Inquirer.
